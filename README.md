# WaterApp - Project course work

This is the repo of the code for UI of WaterApp created as a part of a project course in MSc studies.
The UI has been completely created using [FlutterFlow](https://www.flutterflow.io/) (free version), a low-code platform for app development.
The backend is implemented with dart and database management via [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).
